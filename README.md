I was tired of seeing so-called "vanilla" packs that often contained a lot of homebrew with unmaintained configurations so I made mine which is currently manual (I do it myself) but later I will make it automatic.




### what is in this pack?
latest version of :
- [Atmosphere-NX /
Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere)
  * 90DNS
  * system_settings.ini (disable cheats by default)
  * exosphere.ini (incognito aka blank prod)
  * ips patches (sigpatches)
- [CTCaer /
hekate](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate)
  * boot entries (sysnand or emunand)
  * boot.ini
  * boot.dat for modchips
- [configs](https://github.com/pinokaille/Vanillatmosphere/tree/main/configs) 👆
